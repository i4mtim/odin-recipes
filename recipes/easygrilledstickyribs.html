    <h2>Descirption</h2>
        <p>
            I've always been fine with the old saying, "rules are meant to be broken," especially culinary rules, as long as the final results come out just as good, if not better. Unfortunately, not everyone's as liberal as I am when it comes to such deviations, with "real" barbecue pitmasters being a perfect example. To them, the idea of baking a rack of ribs, cutting it up, and then grilling each rib glazed with a sticky sauce is nothing short of sacrilege.
            Well, that's too bad for them, since these "Easy Grilled Sticky Ribs," were easy, relatively fast, and incredibly delicious. Or, as I would describe to them in the words of that great American philosopher, Homer Simpson, "sacrilicious." Don't get me wrong, as do I love a classically prepared, low-and-slow, smoked rack of ribs, but what I've never understood is having to choose between the two. Can't we have both, depending on our mood, and schedule?
            Anyway, to make it up to them a little bit, I respectfully called these, "Grilled Sticky Ribs," and not, "barbecued ribs," although I'm pretty sure that's what most people will refer to them as, which is fine by me. Semantic gymnastics aside, these ribs are a proven crowd-pleaser, and no matter what you call these, I really do hope you give this a try soon.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic poweder</li>
            <li>2 racks baby back prok ribs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Glaze:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 Cup ketchup</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F</li>
            <li>Mix salt,sugar,black pepper,paprika and garlic powder for dry rub togehter in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Line a large sheet pan with heav-duty aluminum foil. Place rack of ribs on the prepared pan, bone side down. Poke all over with a sharp knife. Make shallow slits across at an angle, and then repeat the opposite way; this allows the dry rub to penetrate. Coat on both sides with rub;flip back over, ensuring the bone side is down. Wrap tightly with foil.</li>
            <li> Transfer to the center of the preheated oven and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold and firm, at least 2 hours, up to overnight</li>
            <li>Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very ashy and hot</li>
            <li>Remove from the refrigerator, unwrap, and brush off excess fat. Slice between the bones to separate each rib</li>
            <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, oil and cayenne with a spoon in a bowl for glaze</li>
            <li>Place ribs on the preheated grill and cook for 2 minutes; flip and brush over glaze. Flip and repeat the process untill ribs are as caramelized as you prefer, about 10 minutes more</li>
            <li>Remove to a plate and Brush over one more application of glaze. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
